BlameBot is a Python-based tool designed to help families analyze their financial data using advanced AI techniques like ChatGPT, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and clustering. It processes financial statements from various sources, unifies the data, and generates insightful reports to better understand spending habits. And yes, it might just give you more reasons to argue.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Supports processing of financial statements from US credit cards (USD) and UK bank accounts (GBP).
- **Amazon cross referencing**: Refines transaction descriptions by cross referencing Amazon order history.
- **AI-Driven Clustering**: Uses FastText embeddings and clustering algorithms (HDBSCAN, DBSCAN, or KMeans) to categorize transactions.
- **Smart Categorization**: Leverages GPT-4o to refine and clarify cluster names for intuitive spending categories.
- **Visual Insights**: Generates a word cloud and bar chart to visualize spending patterns and monthly expenditures.

## Project Structure

- `src/BlameBot.py`: The main Python script containing all the code for data processing, clustering, and report generation.
- `BlameBot.png`: The project logo featuring our mischievous AI overlord mascot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run BlameBot, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- The required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- An OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 based cluster name clarification)

### Installation

Before running the Python code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed.

1. System Dependency (macOS):
    ```
    bash
    brew reinstall wkhtmltopdf
    ```
    
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlameBot.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BlameBot
   ```
4. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
### Setup

1. **Prepare Your Data:**
   - Place your US credit card CSV statements in the directory `data/us_credit_card_statements/`.
   - Place your UK bank account CSV statements in the directory `data/uk_bank_statements/`.
   - Place your Amazon order history CSV files in the directory `data/Amazon/`.
   
2. **Configure Your OpenAI API Key:**
   - Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
     ```

### Usage

To run the tool and generate reports:

```bash
python BlameBot.py
```

## Customizing for Your Own Use

To adapt BlameBot to your specific needs, you might consider the following customizations:

### Data Format

- Ensure that your CSV files follow the expected structure with consistent columns across all files for each account type.
- Modify the `AccountProcessor` classes (`uk_bank` and `us_credit_card`) to fit the format of your statements if they differ significantly.

### Clustering Configuration

- Experiment with different clustering algorithms by modifying the `AI_FastText_Classifier` class:
  - **HDBSCAN**: Adjust parameters like `min_cluster_size` and `min_samples` to see how it affects clustering.
  - **DBSCAN**: Uncomment and adjust parameters like `eps` and `min_samples`.
  - **KMeans**: Set the number of clusters manually to explore various segmentation strategies.

### Improving Cluster Naming

- If the cluster names generated by GPT-4o are not satisfactory, tweak the `AIClarification` function's prompt in the `AI_FastText_Classifier` class.

### Visualizations

- Modify the `ShameCloud` function to customize the word cloud (e.g., change the color scheme or the maximum number of words).
- Adjust the bar chart code to fit your aesthetic or data requirements.

## Example Outputs

### Word Cloud

### Monthly Expenditures

### Reports

The good news and the bad (in html and PDF, with and without redacting in case you want to hide your shame while going viral).
Reports minimialist and colorful. The PDF files are so colorful they'll blow your printing budget.  Here are examples, redacted to protect the guilty:

   - [Another Example](https://blamebot.com/report2.html)
   - [Okay, but this is the last one](https://blamebot.com/report3.html)

### Words of wisdom

Each report ends with a pearl of wisdom inspired by your spending habits. Examples:

## Fun FAQs

1. **Why are the reports different every time? Even the layout and colors change.**

   - BlameBot is a creative entity that cannot be pinned down to one artistic style.

1. **My report looks outlandish. The images are the size of the moon!  What gives?**

   - BlameBot has full artistic license when it comes to color scheme, report layout, etc. Occasionaly it halucinates a style so inovative that it isn't human redable. When that happens, try, try again.

2. **Did your artist in residence make the adorable BlameBot logo?**

   - No. As you might guess from the quality of our financial wisdom, we couldn't afford a human artist. We outsourced that task to OpenAI's Dalle.
